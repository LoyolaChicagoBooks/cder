Chapter Title - TBD
=================================

This is the first paragraph.

Here is an example of a code snippet.
I just chose our Scala Hello, World, even though our chapter is going 
to use Java examples.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/hello-scala-eclipse/src/hello/Main.scala
   :start-after: begin-Main
   :end-before: end-Main
   :linenos:

This example shows how to include the entire file verbatim. 
I usually avoid this for larger programs. It is best to use comments to identify 
important fragments of code for inclusion.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/hello-scala-eclipse/src/hello/Main.scala
   :linenos:
