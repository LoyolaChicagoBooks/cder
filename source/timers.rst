Interactive Behaviors and Implicit Concurrency with Internal Timers
===================================================================

Learning objectives
-------------------

**TODO** streamline

- Modeling
  - Distinguishing between view states and (behavioral) model states
- Semantics
  - Internal events from background timers
  - Concurrency issues: single-thread rule of accessing/updating the view in the GUI thread
- Architecture and Design (focus on relevant essentials here)
  - Distinguishing among dumb, reactive, and autonomous model components
  - Implementing state-dependent behavior using the State pattern
  - Command pattern for representing tasks as objects
  - Fa√ßade pattern for hiding complexity in the model from the adapter
  - Relevant class-level design principles
    - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
    - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
    - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
  - Package-level architecture and relevant principles
    - Dependency graph (see also here)
    - Stable Dependencies Principle (SDP)
    - Acyclic Dependencies Principle (ADP)
  - Architectural journey
- Testing
  - Different types of testing
    - Component-level unit testing
    - System testing
    - Instrumentation testing
    - Mock-based testing
    - Testcase Superclass pattern
    - Test coverage

   :scale: 100%

   The Model-View-Adapter (MVA) architecture of the countdown timer 
   Android app. Solid arrows represent (synchronous) method invocation, 
   and dashed arrows represent (asynchronous) events. Here, both the 
   view components and the model's autonomous timer send events to
   the adapter.

**TODO** code examples

- listener interfaces
- adapter
  - receive view events
  - receive model events
- model
  - state pattern
  - implementation of timeouts
  - wiring pieces together
- testing?
