Summary
=================

In this chapter, we have studied various parallel and distributed
computing topics from a user-centric software development
angle. Specifically, in the context of mobile application development,
we have studied the basic building blocks of interactive applications
in the form of events, timers, and asynchronous activities, along with
related software modeling, architecture, and design topics.

The complete source code for the examples from this chapter is
available from [CS313Ex]_. For further reading on designing concurrent
object-oriented software, have a look at [HPJPC]_, [CPJ2E]_, and
[JCP]_.

We are grateful to our graduate students Michael Dotson and Audrey
Redovan for having contributed their countdown timer implementation.
