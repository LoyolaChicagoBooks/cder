Introduction
=================

In this chapter, we study parallel and distributed computing topics
from a user-centric software development angle, focusing on
concurrency. Topics include batch versus event-driven execution (and
scheduling), external and internal events, the event-action paradigm,
state machines, background tasks, offloading computation (say, from a
mobile device to the cloud or computing cluster) and observing the
resulting throughput-latency tradeoff.

While our focus will be on user-centric computing, we note that in
today’s context, most mobile platforms are essentially shared-memory
multiprocessor parallel systems in their own right. Today’s
smartphones and tablets sport multicore architecture, and even
projects such as Parallela kickstarter are a sign that mobile
platforms may well be the next wave of low-power parallel computing.
Therefore, we view studying user-centric platforms/devices not only as
an effective way to learn parallel computing but also a fun way to do
so.
